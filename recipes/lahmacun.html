<h2> Directions </h2>
<ol>
    <li> <p> Make lamb sauce: Combine onion, parsley, bell peppers, basil, mint, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, paprika, coriander seed, and cumin. <br>
         Pulse until vegetables are finely chopped. Add tomatoes and process until mixture is a thick puree. </p></li>

    <li><p> Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add lamb, pureed vegetable mixture, and tomato paste; mix well. <br>
        Cook and stir until lamb is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in cayenne pepper and salt to taste.<br> 
        Transfer mixture to a shallow baking dish to cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.<p> </li>

    <li> <p>Make dough: Dissolve yeast and sugar in 1 cup warm water. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl and stir well.<br>
        Add 1/2 cup water and oil to yeast mixture and pour over flour mixture. Use your hands to mix dough. <br>
        Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. </p></li>

    <li> <p>Shape dough into a ball and transfer to an oiled bowl. <br>
        Cover with a wet towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. <br>
         Remove lamb sauce from the refrigerator and allow to come up to room temperature. </p></li>

    <li><p> Meanwhile, make garlic sauce: Combine yogurt, parsley, and garlic in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Stir well and set aside. </p></li>

    <li><p>Punch dough down, transfer it to a floured work surface, and cut into 10 portions. <br>
        Shape each portion into a round. Flatten each round with your hand; use a rolling pin to roll each piece into a 10-inch circle.<br>
        The dough should be thin, like a crepe. Place the rounds on parchment paper.</p> </li>

    <li> <p>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. </p></li>

    <li> <p>Stir lamb sauce and spoon it onto a dough round. Spread it thinly to the edges and press down lightly so it sticks. Place on the prepared baking sheets. </li>

    <li> <p> Bake pizzas on the lowest oven rack in the preheated oven until the edges are a light tan color, 8 to 10 minutes.<br>
        Place on a wire rack to cool. The pizzas can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 3 months. <br>
        To reheat, place pizzas in a 350 degrees F oven (175 degrees C) for 8 minutes. </p></li>

    <li> <p>Assemble lahmacun: Drizzle pizzas with garlic sauce, top with shredded cabbage, and roll up to eat. </p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
<p> Additional condiments include chili sauce, harissa, or Tabasco. In place of the cabbage, you can combine 1 cup lettuce, thinly sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and red onion. <br>
To assemble, arrange cabbage, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, or onion down one side of the pizza. <br>
Drizzle with garlic sauce and hot sauce, and roll up. Eat and enjoy, but watch out for the drip. You won't want to miss a bite! <br>
If you can't find ground lamb in your area, you may substitute ground beef. </p>
